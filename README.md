# Plasticity
Implementation for Thesis Chapter 2

The code is written in cython to optimise the running speed of the simulations.
.pyx has to be compiled before used. Package used for c code compilation was easycython.

Run main.py file to run the experiments - one at a time. The file name and location for storing the results for each experiment should be specified in main.py file. The settings for each experiment can be adjusted in the constants.py file accordingly.
